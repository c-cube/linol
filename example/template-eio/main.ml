(* Some user code

   The code here is just a placeholder to make this file compile, it is expected
   that users have an implementation of a processing function for input contents.

   Here we expect a few things:
   - a type to represent a state/environment that results from processing an
     input file
   - a function procdessing an input file (given the file contents as a string),
     which return a state/environment
   - a function to extract a list of diagnostics from a state/environment.
     Diagnostics includes all the warnings, errors and messages that the processing
     of a document are expected to be able to return.

let process_some_input_file (_file_contents : string) : state_after_processing =
  ()

let diagnostics (_state : state_after_processing) : Lsp.Types.Diagnostic.t list

  []

(* Lsp server class

   This is the main point of interaction beetween the code checking documents
   (parsing, typing, etc...), and the code of linol.

   The [Linol_eio.Jsonrpc2.server] class defines a method for each of the action
   that the lsp server receives, such as opening of a document, when a document
   changes, etc.. By default, the method predefined does nothing (or errors out ?),
   so that users only need to override methods that they want the server to
   actually meaningfully interpret and respond to.
