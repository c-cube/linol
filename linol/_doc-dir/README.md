# Linol [![build](https://github.com/c-cube/linol/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/c-cube/linol/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is a wrapper around the `lsp` library, which provides base types for the protocol. Linol ("linol is not ocaml-lsp") provides an object abstraction so that users can override only the methods they provide, and a Lwt implementation of the jsonrpc wire protocol.
